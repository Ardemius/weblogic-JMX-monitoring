This article was tested with *WebLogic 11g (10.3.2)*.

== WebLogic configuration checks

In the *WebLogic Admin console*:

* in `<your_weblogic_domain> / Configuration / General / Advanced Settings`, enable both `Compatibility MBean Server Enabled` and `Management EJB Enabled`. +
This will enable the JMX Management Server in the WebLogic Admin console. (legacy and new JMX interface) +
This change requires a restart.

== Find the MBean Servers running in WebLogic

At the launch of WebLogic Server, in the domain logs (`<your_weblogic_domain>\logs\<your_weblogic_server>.log`), search for the `<BEA-149512>` tag indicating that the Mbean servers were started.

Example with `<your_weblogic_domain>\logs\<your_weblogic_server>.log`:

----

This will give you the URI to use in order to access the JMX MBeans. +
It matches the pattern: 
[source]
----
service:jmx:iiop://<weblogic_server_host>:<weblogic_server_port>/<MBean_server_name>
----
Where *MBean_server_name* can take the following values:

* `weblogic.management.mbeanservers.runtime`: for navigating the hierarchy of WebLogic Server runtime MBeans and active configuration MBeans for the current server.
* `weblogic.management.mbeanservers.edit`: for managing the configuration of the current WebLogic Server domain.
* `weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime`: for navigating to all runtime and configuration MBeans in the domain as well as to MBeans that provide domain-wide services (such as controlling and monitoring the life cycles of servers and message-driven EJBs and coordinating the migration of migratable services).

[NOTE]
====
The `domainruntime` and `edit` MBean servers can only be accessed from the WebLogic *Admin Server*. +
`runtime` one only needs an access to a *Managed Server*.
====

== Launch the JConsole

[NOTE]
====
The *JConsole* graphical user interface is a *monitoring tool* that complies to the *Java Management Extensions* (JMX) specification.
====

It can be launched, and, in our case, connects to the *WebLogic JMX agent*, using the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
@set JAVA_HOME=<path to your JDK installation>
 
%JAVA_HOME%\bin\jconsole -J-Djava.class.path=%JAVA_HOME%\lib\jconsole.jar;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar;<connector-path> -J-Djmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs=weblogic.management.remote -debug
----

The JConsole options used are:

* `java.class.path=%JAVA_HOME%\lib\jconsole.jar;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar;<weblogic-connector-path>`: As the *WebLogic JMX agent* uses a *connector* which is not included in the Java platform, you need to *add the connector classes to the classpath* of the JConsole underlying JVM. +
A possibility is to indicate here the path of a `wlfullclient.jar`, but *that's not the only option*. +
For more details on this point, check the section about <<WebLogic_connectors,WebLogic connectors classes for remote JMX Clients>>.
* `-J-Djmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs=weblogic.management.remote`: identifies the package implementing WebLogic's client side connectors code. By example, the 't3' or 'iiop' client connectors.
* `-debug`: useful when a connection failure occurs, as the corresponding stack trace is displayed on the console.

Once launched, select `Remote Process`, and fill out the target WebLogic MBeanServer URI, plus the WebLogic username and password:

image::JConsole_Remote_Process.png[JConsole - Remote Process,align="center"]

In this example, we chose to connect to the `domainruntime` server (as we are on local, with only 1 instance running, which is of course the Admin Server) through `IIOP` protocol. +
So the URI used is: 
[source,bash]
----
service:jmx:iiop://localhost:7001/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----
For the `t3` protocol, it would be:
[source,bash]
----
service:jmx:t3://localhost:7001/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----

[CAUTION]
====
On Unix servers, the user launching the JConsole must also be *the owner of the WebLogic Server processes* to see them appear in the JConsole.
====

== Launch VisualVM

Instead of *JConsole*, you can use *VisualVM* (its successor). +
It offers some more advanced features than JConsole, such as *profiling* (CPU and memory), which can even be extended through various plugins.

Here are some (very) useful ones:

* Visual MBeans: Integrates JConsole's MBeans tab functionality into VisualVM, to navigate through the JMX MBeans hierarchies.
* JConsole plugins container: A plugin to enable using custom JConsole plugins in VisualVM. +
Especially useful if you developed some special tabs for JConsole you need to reuse in VisualVM)
* Visual GC: Visual Garbage Collection monitoring tool, to check the Java Memory Model and GC actions in real time.

They can be installed by 2 ways:

* either directly in VisualVM, through `Tools` >> `Plugins` >> `Available Plugins` tab >> `Check for Newest`
* or by downloading them from the http://visualvm.java.net/pluginscenters.html[official Plugins Center], then `Tools` >> `Plugins` >> `Downloaded` tab >> `Add Plugins...`
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to download the plugins versions associated with your VisualVM version. +
For *Java 8*, the embedded VisualVM is a *1.3.6*.
====

As for the JConsole, to connect to the *WebLogic JMX agent*, it has to be launched using the following commands:
[source,bash]
----
@set JAVA_HOME=<path to your JDK installation>
 
%JAVA_HOME%\bin\jvisualvm --cp:a <connector-path> -J-Djmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs=weblogic.management.remote
----
Then add a new JMX connection, using the same URI as for JConsole. +
By example:
[source,bash]
----
service:jmx:t3://localhost:7001/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----

[NOTE]
====
The *VisualVM logs* are available at the following path:

* for Linux: `<userdir>/.visualvm/<version>/var/log/messages.log`
* for Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.visualvm\<version>\var\log\messages.log`
====

[[WebLogic_connectors]]
== WebLogic connectors classes and associated jars for remote JMX Clients

*This section is optional* regarding the main goal of this article: monitoring WebLogic using remote JMX client (like JConsole or VisualVM). +
Nevertheless, understanding the available features of the different WebLogic jars, *containing the connector classes*, can ease your way when *developing your own stand-alone JMX WebLogic client*. +
Brace yourself, depending on your constraints, *this can be tricky*...

=== Server-side applications

As the name implies, the server-side operations require a *complete WebLogic Server installation*. +

You are in this case when, in addition to JMX monitoring, you need the following operations:

* administrative operations such as *deployment*
* operations necessary for *development purposes*, such as `ejbc` or `appc`.footnote:[for appc and ejbc compilers, look at this https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E28280_01/web.1111/e13719/appc_ejbc.htm#EJBPG1088[Oracle Help Center page].]
* *WLST* and client-side JSR 88 applications that invoke server-side operations.footnote:[WLST: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29542_01/web.1111/e13715/using_wlst.htm#WLSTG118[WebLogic Scripting Tool], a command-line scripting environment that you can use to create, manage, and monitor WebLogic domains.]

A client needing those lasts requires the `weblogic.jar`, which is part of the WebLogic Server installation.

It also means that, *if directly on the WebLogic server*, we could launch the JConsole with the following connector path:
[source,bash]
----
java.class.path=%JAVA_HOME%\lib\jconsole.jar;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar;%WL_HOME%\server\lib\weblogic.jar // <1>
----
<1> `WL_HOME`: WebLogic home, something like `[...]\wlserver_10.3`

To use the `t3` protocol to connect to the `domainruntime` server, your URI must match the pattern:
[source,bash]
----
service:jmx:t3://<mbean_server_host>:<mbean_server_port>/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----

=== Client-side applications

All the jars listed discussed below have in common that they do *not* need any other WebLogic libraries / dependencies to work on the *client*. +
You just have to add them, and *only them*, to your client classpath.

==== wlfullclient.jar

From WebLogic Server 11g (10.3.x), *client applications* requiring to provide WebLogic Server-specific features, in addition to JMX monitoring, need the `wlfullclient.jar`. +
You *can't* use the former `weblogic.jar`.

Contrary to its name, this jar *doesn't really allow all that is possible server-side*. +
Here are its features and limitations:

* features
** supports `t3` and `t3s` WebLogic protocols for RMI (respectively RMI over HTTP, and RMI over HTTPS for HTTP tunneling over SSL). +
Those protocols are faster and more scalable that IIOP.
** supports most WebLogic Server-specific features.
** supports WebLogic Server clustering.
** supports most JEE features.
** Supports WebLogic JMS, JMS SAF clients, and JMS C clients.
* limitations
** Web Services not supported, you need to add `wseeclient.jar`
** operations necessary for *development purposes*, such as `ejbc` or `appc`, not supported. Those last are *server-side only*, and require `weblogic.jar`

To use this jar to connect to JConsole, indicate its path as connector path.
[source,bash]
----
java.class.path=%JAVA_HOME%\lib\jconsole.jar;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar;<your_weblogic_path_to>\wlfullclient.jar
----
To use the `t3` protocol to connect to the `domainruntime` server, your URI must match the pattern:
[source,bash]
----
service:jmx:t3://<mbean_server_host>:<mbean_server_port>/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----
This jar is *around 55 Mo* for WLS 11g 10.3.x.

[NOTE]
====
The  `wlfullclient.jar` is not natively present on WebLogic Server, and must be generated the following way:

* `cd %WL_HOME%\server\lib`
* `java -jar wljarbuilder.jar` +
This will create the `wlfullclient.jar` in the `server/lib` directory.
====

==== wljmxclient.jar and wlclient.jar

Those jars represent the smallest alternative in size to `wlfullclient.jar`. There are respectively *~50 Ko* and *~500 Ko* for WLS 11g 10.3.x.

The downside is that it is a `RMI-IIOP` only based solution, whose performance is lower that `t3`. +
As a consequence, clients design around a *massive use of multithreading* should *avoid this solution*.

Other limitations are:

* JMS support not included, you must add the `wljmsclient.jar`
* SAF support not included, you must add the `wlsafclient.jar` footnote:[SAF: *Store-And-Forward* service for JMS. For more details, look at this https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs90/saf_admin/overview.html[Oracle Help Center page].]

Those 2 jars can be found in `%WL_HOME%\server\bin`.

To use them to connect to JConsole, indicate their paths as connector path.
[source,bash]
----
java.class.path=%JAVA_HOME%\lib\jconsole.jar;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar;<your_weblogic_path_to>\wljmxclient.jar;<your_weblogic_path_to>\wlclient.jar
----
Then, to connect to the `domainruntime` server, your URI must match the pattern:
[source,bash]
----
service:jmx:iiop://<mbean_server_host>:<mbean_server_port>/jndi/weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime
----

[NOTE]
====
As explained in https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12839_01/web.1111/e13728/accesswls.htm#JMXCU152[Oracle Help Center], `wlclient.jar` is included in `wljmxclient.jar`{empty}'s MANIFEST ClassPath entry, so `wlclient.jar` and `wljmxclient.jar` need to be in the *same directory*, or both jars need to be specified on the classpath.

Ensure that `weblogic.jar` or `wlfullclient.jar` is *not included* in the classpath if `wljmxclient.jar` is included. +
Only the thin client `wljmxclient.jar` / `wlclient.jar` or the thick client `wlfullclient.jar` should be used, but not a combination of both.
====

==== wlthint3client.jar

This jar is a thin WebLogic `t3` client, that represents a *good compromise* between *size* (*~3 Mo* for WLS 11g 10.3.x) and *performance* (better than IIOP with `wljmxclient.jar` / `wlclient.jar`).

* features
** JMX support (of course), but also JMS, JMX, JNDI, and EJB resources available in WebLogic Server.
** Transaction initiation and termination (rollback or commit) using JTA.
** WebLogic client JMS features, including Unit-of-Order, Unit-of-Work, message compression, XML messages, JMS automatic client reconnect, and Destination Availability Helper APIs.
** Client-side clustering allowing a client application to participate in failover and load balancing of a WebLogic Server instance.
** JAAS authentication footnote:[JAAS: Java Authentication and Authorization Service].
** JSSE footnote:[JSSE: Java Secure Socket Extension].
* limitations
** RMI over HTTPS (HTTP Tunneling over SSL) not supported.
** JMS SAF clients, Mbean-based utilities (such as JMS Helper, JMS Module Helper), and JMS multicast are not supported.
** JDBC resources, including WebLogic JDBC extensions are not supported.
** Can't run a WebLogic RMI server in the client.
** Network class loading.

This jar can also be found in `%WL_HOME%\server\bin`.

To use it to connect to JConsole, indicate its path as connector path.

=== conclusion

To build your own JMX WebLogic client:

* If the size is not a problem, use the `wlfullclient.jar`.
* If you have less space available, `wlthint3client.jar` guarantees good performance for ~3 Mo (but don't forget the limitations)
* `wlclient.jar` and `wljmxclient.jar` are to be used when the available space is very limited, as their features are limited.
* In any case, if your client need to use WLST, appc / ejbc, or administrative operations, the WebLogic
